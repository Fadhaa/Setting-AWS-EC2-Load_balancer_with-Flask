# AWS Flask App Deployment Guide

This repository documents the step-by-step instructions to deploy a Flask web application securely on AWS using EC2, VPC, Load Balancer, HTTPS, and Route 53.

## ðŸ“‚ Deployment Steps

Below are the individual guides, in the recommended execution order:

1. âœ… **[vpc-requirements.md](./docs/vpc-requirements.md)**  
   Set up a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public subnets, route tables, and an internet gateway.

2. âœ… **[ec2_settup.md](./docs/ec2_settup.md)**  
   Launch and configure an EC2 instance inside your VPC with key pair, security group, and IAM role.

3. âœ… **[setting_flask.md](./docs/setting_flask.md)**  
   Install and configure your Flask application on the EC2 instance, including WSGI server setup (e.g., Gunicorn) and reverse proxy using Nginx.

4. âœ… **[creatingACM.md](./docs/creatingACM.md)**  
   Request and validate an SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for your domain.

5. âœ… **[Load-balancer.md](./docs/Load-balancer.md)**  
   Set up an Application Load Balancer with HTTP and HTTPS listeners. Forward HTTPS traffic to your Flask app.

6. âœ… **[settingRecords.md](./docs/settingRecords.md)**  
   Use Route 53 to configure domain records and connect your domain to the Load Balancer using alias or A records.
